			<h3>Ruins of the Palace of Knossos</h3>
			<p>It is a palace created by the Minoan civilization, who were the ones who lived in Crete in ancient Greece. It was the ceremonial and political centre of Minoan culture. The palace was abandoned and the reason for this desertion is still a mystery. There are many frescoes and columns from the Minoan culture.</p>
